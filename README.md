**📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Before training the LSTM model, EDA was performed to uncover key insights:

**🔹 Key Plots & Insights**

📌 Stock Trends Over Time – Closing price analysis for trend detection.
📌 Moving Averages – 10-day, 20-day, and 50-day moving averages for trend smoothing.
📌 Daily Return Distribution – Histograms showcasing stock volatility.
📌 Stock Correlation Analysis – Heatmaps & scatter plots showing stock relationships.
📌 Risk vs Expected Return – Bubble chart highlighting risk-reward tradeoffs.

**🤖 LSTM-Based Stock Price Prediction**

A Bidirectional LSTM model was trained using Apple's historical stock data.

**🔹 Model Training Steps**

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing – MinMaxScaler applied to closing prices.

2️⃣ Feature Engineering – Created 100-day input sequences for prediction.

3️⃣ LSTM Model Architecture –

Bidirectional LSTM layers with dropout & regularization.
Dense layers with ReLU activation.
Adam optimizer with Mean Squared Error (MSE).

4️⃣ Training Optimization –
Early Stopping & Learning Rate Reduction applied.
RMSE: 4.86, ensuring reliable forecasting.

5️⃣ Prediction & Visualization – Compared actual vs. predicted prices.
📜 AI-Generated Financial Insights (GPT-4)
A GPT-4 powered report generator analyzes historical vs. forecasted stock prices, producing AI-driven insights.

**🔹 AI Report Covers**

✅ Trend Analysis – Market momentum, stability, and volatility.
✅ Prediction Accuracy – Differences between actual & predicted prices.
✅ Risk Factors – Discusses economic & market conditions affecting the stock.
✅ Investment Insights – AI-generated strategies based on forecast data.
